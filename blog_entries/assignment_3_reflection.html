		<h1>Assignment 3 Reflection</h1>
		<p>May 9th, 2021</p>
		<p>This assignment felt easier overall than assignment 2, although it presented its own challenges that were difficult in a different sort of way.
			I struggled quite a bit with implementing the search functionality because I started out using for loops, unaware that removing elements inside
			the loops would throw their indices off. After I rewrote the loops as while loops, things went a bit more smoothly. JavaScript is entirely new
			territory, so everything in this assignment was new to me. However, I think that implementing the event listeners was the most novel concept. I
			used MDN Web Docs and Campuswire a lot for insights on the assignment, and MDN especially helped with understanding the nuances between the different
			functions for selecting elements from the DOM. I also spent a decent amount of time looking up how string comparisons worked in JavaScript.</p>
