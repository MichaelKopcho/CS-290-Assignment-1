		<h1>Assignment 1 Reflection</h1>
		<p>April 10th, 2021</p>
		<p>This assignment wasn't too difficult; I think the most difficult part was formatting my picture so that it wasn't gigantic.
			I ended up using the height and width attributes to resize the image, although I realize that this would normally be handled with CSS.
			I don't think I learned anything new with this assignment, but it was good practice for implementing the HTML concepts we learned about in class.
			I found reviewing the example code to be really helpful, especially for seeing how to use relative urls in link tags.
			Although it's not required or anything, I'd like to come back and touch up these pages later in the term.</p>
