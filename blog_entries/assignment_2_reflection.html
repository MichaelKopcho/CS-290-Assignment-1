		<h1>Assignment 2 Reflection</h1>
		<p>April 26th, 2021</p>
		<p>This assignment was definitely a step up in difficulty from the first one, although that may be in part because I started on it much later than I should have.
			I struggled a lot with getting the positioning of everything right, it was difficult to know when to use the position atribute over a flex box or just messing with the
			padding and margins. In the end, I kind of just had to go by trial and error until my page looked like the mocks. The biggest takeaway I gained from this assignment was
			that the workflow of programming in CSS is much different from the other classes I've taken at OSU. The changes made are so fine-grain and individually tailored that I
			found myself almost constantly going back and testing the page, whereas when working on an assignment in C/C++ I'd usually work on a component of it and then test.
			I did a lot of internet searching for this assignment, but I found that MDN Web Docs was especially helpful for better understanding CSS.</p>
