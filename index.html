		<h2>Course-related Facts About Me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When I was younger (probably around middle school), I had a decent knowledge of HTML/CSS, 
				<br>and I used to make really tacky websites for all of my interests.</li>
			<li>Since this is an introductory class, I don't expect to be a master at web development by the end of the term, 
				<br>but I'd like to be able to design a website that is functional, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
			<li>I have signed up for the course Campuswire.</li>
			<li>This isn't an interesting fact about me per se, but something interesting that I've been working on lately is 
				<br>intentionally corrupting and distorting videos and images to make multimedia artwork.</li>
